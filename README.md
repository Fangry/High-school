# High-school

Hello world! This is here I keep all my high stuff stuff.

When I get bored, I try out different ideas in Processing. You can find random but cool stimulations in the "Processing Experiment" folder.  

I am also practing contest problems such as the Canadian Computing Contest in Python and Java. You can find them in the "Contest Problems" folder.
